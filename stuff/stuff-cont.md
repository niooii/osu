# Improvements
Some major improvements were made in the time of me writing this:

- The model learned how to spin
- The model learned idle cursor movement

Major improvements:
- Switch to VAE
- Feed the VAE sliding window of frames, instead of the current one only
- KL annealing
- Training data gathered from **one person**


blah blah etc.  

## Data
Turns out, osu! does a monthly score dump of the top 10,000 players over at https://data.ppy.sh/.  Very cool.
